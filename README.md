# Vehicle Management System

## Overview
This project implements a basic vehicle management system using object-oriented programming concepts in C++. It includes classes for various types of vehicles, demonstrating polymorphism and inheritance.

## Features
- Class definitions for `Car`, `Bike`, and `Vehicle`, showcasing hierarchical relationships.
- Implementation of polymorphic behavior allowing dynamic handling of different vehicle types.
- Demonstrates object instantiation and method overriding.

## Requirements
- C++11 or later
- g++ or another compatible C++ compiler
  
### Files Included
- Car.hpp: Header file with declarations for vehicle-related classes.
- Car.cpp: Implementation of the Car class methods.
- main.cpp: Main driver program demonstrating the capabilities of the vehicle classes.
